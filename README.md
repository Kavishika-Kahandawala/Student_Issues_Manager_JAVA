This is the Final evaluation source code for the project "Student issue manager" software written using Java.
This was done as a 1st year 2nd semester group project, under "OOP" module in my university life.
The original repository which consisits all the contribution can also be found on my repository list.
But as that original repository wasn't completed (Final code isn't submitted there, only partial), I've uploaded the Final Full Source Code here.

And as the project already completed, I'll Archive this but will remain public.

Feel Free to look around.
